## Project Overview

Smart Sportz is a frontend foundation for an enterprise sports tournament management platform. It covers public discovery, registrations, payments, live scoring, super admin operations, management portal workflows, participant dashboards, CMS, logs, and reporting.

The project is built as a separated React application, with each major page placed in its own file under `frontend/src/pages`.

## Live Deployment

GitHub Actions is configured to deploy the Vite frontend to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
The repository also includes Vercel and Render deployment configuration for free-tier hosting.

Expected Pages URL after deployment:

```text
https://mr-asmath.github.io/Smart_Sportz/
```

Expected Vercel frontend URL after importing this repository:

```text
https://smart-sportz.vercel.app/
```

Expected Render backend URL after creating the Blueprint service:

```text
https://smart-sportz-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/health
```

## Local Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Local URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

## Production Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The production files are generated into:

```text
frontend/dist
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Deployment is handled by:

```text
.github/workflows/pages.yml
```

The workflow:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs frontend dependencies with `npm ci`.
3. Builds the Vite app from `frontend`.
4. Uploads `frontend/dist` as the GitHub Pages artifact.
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Vercel Frontend Deployment

Vercel deployment is configured by:

```text
vercel.json
```

The config builds the React app from `frontend`, outputs `frontend/dist`, sets the hosted base path to `/`, and rewrites all routes to `index.html` for React Router.

Default hosted API target:

```text
https://smart-sportz-backend.onrender.com/api/v1
```

If your Render backend URL is different, update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel project environment variables.

## Render Backend Deployment

Render deployment is configured by:

```text
render.yaml
```

The free web service runs:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

The committed Blueprint uses SQLite for a zero-secret deployment. Keep the SQLite files on persistent disk and do not set Supabase/PostgreSQL URLs:

```text
DATABASE_BACKEND=sqlite
DATABASE_PATH=storage/smartsportz.db
MIRROR_DATABASE_PATH=storage/smartsportz_mirror.db
AUDIT_DATABASE_PATH=storage/smartsportz_audit.db
INIT_DB_ON_STARTUP=true
SEED_DB_ON_STARTUP=false
CLEANUP_MEDIA_ON_STARTUP=false
```

## Design Direction

The UI is designed as a premium SaaS product with:

- Clean white surfaces.
- Dark mode available as a user setting.
- Polished cards, tables, dashboards, and portal shells.
- Smooth route transitions.
- Consistent spacing, radius, shadows, and typography.
- Responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## Documentation Included

The repository includes Word documentation for:

- Foundation architecture.
- Design system and landing page.
- Public website.
- Registration and payment flow.
- Super admin portal.
- Management portal.
- Live score engine.
- Backend architecture and APIs.
- Database architecture.
- Frontend architecture.
- DevOps and CI/CD.
- Master frontend, backend, database, and API specifications.
